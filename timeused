TODO: 
audio?
make chat finish conversation.
Use the code provided in the repo and implement the missing capabilities (context_logger.py and intake_processor.py)
Adds function calling and states to LLM to fit it to the task
ContextLogger is a FrameProcessor which should print in the console the
 conversation context after each message. Additionally, it could also save
 the conversation transcript to a file. Feel free to get creative here.

Suggest 3 ways to improve the accuracy of the bot


Start presenting as an assistant that will help schedule an appointment for the doctor
Ask for the user’s full name and date of birth to validate the information. It needs to ensure that it is +18 years to continue.
To simulate a user validation, sum the digits of the date of birth. If the sum mod 3 is 0, the user is NOT validated and the bot should tell the user that the records were not found in the system and end the conversation.
Eg. the date of birth 1980-11-01 should not pass the validation as the digit sum is 21 that mod 3 is 0
If the user passes the validation, tell the user that the doctor’s availability is:
Monday 7/22 @ 12pm
Tuesday 7/23 @ 3pm
Any date and time after Tuesday
Note: the bot should know the current date “dynamically” so that it can respond accurately to assessments like “in 2 days”
The user should select an appointment date and time. The date and time are the 2 data points that the bot needs to output.
